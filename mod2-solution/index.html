<p>Sushi is healthy.Price for a kilo is 10 $.This Spicy Salmon Sushi Bowl and my Hawaiian Style Tuna Poke Bowl recipes were created because I needed a more filling lunch. After all, I was constantly finding that I was hungry at 2 p.m., even on days when I did eat lunch. So I set out to create a lunch that would keep my belly fuller longer.
These bowls were inspired by popular raw fish and sushi dishes. They serve up at least 30 grams of protein in each dish. Keep reading for the recipe and my tips on buying high-quality seafood.

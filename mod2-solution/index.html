            <p>Chicken tikka masala is chicken tikka, chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt, that is then baked in a tandoor oven, 
            and served in a masala (spice mix) sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but there is no standard recipe for chicken tikka masala; 
            a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken.

                A beefsteak is a flat cut of beef, usually cut perpendicular to the muscle fibers. Beefsteaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled. 
                The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. 
                Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized

            <p>Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients or are vegetarian. Raw fish (or occasionally other meat) sliced and served without rice is called "sashimi". Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Popular garnishes are often made using daikon.
